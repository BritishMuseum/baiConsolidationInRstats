# Consolidation of the @britishmuseum Bronze Age Index

This repo contains R scripts for consolidation of the British Museum's Bronze Age Index. 
These data were created through the efforts of our amazing crowd sourcing volunteers using the 
@micropasts platform. 

During the project planning, we committed to depositing these data with the Archaeology Data Service
at York University. This is part of the process.

# Contents

This repo contains:
 
* R Scripts (generate plots, thank you list, consolidate data, create graphs)
* The data archives
* CSV files of raw and consolidated data
* GeoJSON files of consolidated data
* Plot folder - JPEG images of the plots of BAI drawers.

# License

The scripts are under MIT. These data and maps are CC-BY.
