# Consolidation of the @britishmuseum Bronze Age Index

This repo contains R scripts for consolidation of the British Museum's Bronze Age Index. 
These data were created through the efforts of our amazing crowd sourcing volunteers using the 
@micropasts platform. 

During the project planning, we committed to depositing these data with the Archaeology Data Service
at York University. This is part of the process.

# Contents
